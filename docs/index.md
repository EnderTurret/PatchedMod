# PatchedMod Documentation

Before reading through this, you might want to look at [the library's documentation](https://github.com/EnderTurret/Patched/blob/main/docs/index.md) as it documents most of the things you will encounter.

Here is a list of all the pages in this documentation:
* [Installation](installation.md)
* [Creating patches](creating_patches.md)
* [Extensions](extensions.md)
* [Commands](commands.md)
* [API (for modders)](api.md)
