    Patched features a powerful patching system based mostly on RFC 6902, with extensions added to make it more useful for modding.
    This allows resource/data packs to patch arbitrary json files that would otherwise need to be completely replaced.
    It also comes with several commands to aid in patch debugging or compatibility.
